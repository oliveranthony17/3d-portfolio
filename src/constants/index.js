The app has made house points more visual for the children, they can now keep track of their score and they particularly love the sort from highest to lowest function, it has enthused the kids and they are now more motivated and want to know what they can do to get their house point score up. Oliver thought of some additional functions that have been really useful such as \"award all\" which saves me even more time. The login allows for additional security for GDPR and the kids love the \"declare winner\" function.",
